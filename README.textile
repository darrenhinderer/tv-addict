I wrote this 2 years ago and I can't remember how to set it up!

I do know it requires the facebooker gem. As well as the matching facebooker configuration. I don't think mine is checked in, because it has api codes and such.

Shoot me an email if you run into problems and I'll be happy to take any pull requests with better setup instructions.
